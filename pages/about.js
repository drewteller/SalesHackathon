      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hi, I am Drew Teller A dad joke enthusiast, a growth operator, and the creator of TheProductLed newsletter. I love to teardown growth models and growth tactics of Product-Led Growth SaaS companies. --- I started off my career as a Mechanical Engineer where I spent 3 years designing HVAC systems by using CAD software, peforming energy models for commercial construction projects, and implemented effective software solutions to improve business outcomes. I culminated my tenure as a mechanical engineer by taking the state board PE exam and passed. I am currently still licensed state mechanical engineer. I moved to Sweden in 2018 to get my Masters in Management where I wrote my master's thesis in Strategic Thinking. During my time in Sweden, I founded and created the first donation based yoga company in Sweden where I taught yoga. The business operated at a 56% gross profit margin.
